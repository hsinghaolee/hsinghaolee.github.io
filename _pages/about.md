I am a 3rd year PhD student at NYU in the [Carrasco Lab](https://carrascolab.hosting.nyu.edu/). Currently I am working on the projects investigating the interaction between visual attention and adaptation. 

My primary research interests are **visual attention**, **consciouesness**, and **cognitive control**. To be specific, I ask questions like: How does visual attention interact with perception?, How do the conscious and unconscious mental processes work?, and How do people inhibit irrelevant information and do motor control?

Before joining NYU, I worked with Dr. [Su-Ling Yeh](http://epa.psy.ntu.edu.tw/) at National Taiwan University and Dr. [Shulan Hsieh](http://140.116.183.157/) at National Cheng Kung University.
