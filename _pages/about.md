I am a 4rd year PhD student at NYU in the [Carrasco Lab](https://carrascolab.hosting.nyu.edu/). Currently I am working on the projects investigating the interaction between visual attention and adaptation. 

My primary research interests are **visual attention**, **consciousness**, and **cognitive control**. 

<p> To be specific, I ask questions like:  <br> How does visual attention interact with perception?  <br> How do the conscious and unconscious mental processes work?  <br> How do people inhibit irrelevant information and do motor control? </p>

Before joining NYU, I worked with Dr. [Su-Ling Yeh](http://epa.psy.ntu.edu.tw/) at National Taiwan University and Dr. [Shulan Hsieh](http://140.116.183.157/Eindex.html) at National Cheng Kung University. 

See more in my [CV](http://hsinghaolee.github.io/files/HsingHaoLee_CV_2024.pdf).

Apart from research, I live on Boba and animals. I say Hi to all the dogs on the street, but my favorite is still my dog [Coffee](http://hsinghaolee.github.io/files/Coffee.jpeg), who lives in Taiwan and is 17 years old now!
