I am a 3rd year PhD student at NYU in the [Carrasco Lab](https://carrascolab.hosting.nyu.edu/). Currently I am working on the projects investigating the interaction between visual attention and adaptation. 
My primary research interests are visual attention, consciouesness, and cognitive control. To be specific, I ask questions like: "How does visual attention interact with perception?", "How do the conscious and unconscious mental processes work?", and "How do people inhibit irrelevant information and do motor control?"

Before joining NYU, I worked with Dr. [Su-Ling Yeh](http://epa.psy.ntu.edu.tw/) at National Taiwan University and Dr. [Shulan Hsieh](http://140.116.183.157/) at National Cheng Kung University.
