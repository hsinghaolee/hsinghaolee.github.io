I am a 4th year PhD student at NYU in the [Carrasco Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/carrascolab/). Currently I am working on the projects investigating the interaction between visual attention and adaptation. 

My primary research interests are **visual attention**, **Color vision**, **Multisensory integration** and **cognitive control**. 

<p> To be specific, I ask questions like:  
  <br> How does visual attention interact with perception?  
  <br> How does color vision influence our cognition and perception?
  <br> How do people combine sensory information across modalities?
  <br> How do the conscious and unconscious mental processes work?  
  <br> How do people inhibit irrelevant information and do motor control? </p>


Before joining NYU, I worked with Dr. [Su-Ling Yeh](http://epa.psy.ntu.edu.tw/) at National Taiwan University and Dr. [Shulan Hsieh](http://140.116.183.157/Eindex.html) at National Cheng Kung University.

Apart from research, I live on Boba and animals. I say Hi to all the dogs on the street, but my favorite is still my dog [Coffee](http://hsinghaolee.github.io/files/Coffee.jpeg), who lives in Taiwan and is 18 years old now!
